# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a project I'm coding along with for the Odin Project. This will be my first Javascript project. 

Edit March/22/2023: Be aware that at the time of writing the game only runs in the console, the webpage itself is blank. You need to go into the console and run the command game() to play.

Edit March/24/2023: The game has now been updated with a simple 3 button user-interface you can make a selection with the corresponding button and try to get 5 wins before the computer does, at which point the game will end and the score will be announced.
